Project: Mental Health Survey Clustering Analysis 

The core Python libraries used in this project are only the required ones, seen below and their purpose:

NumPy==1.24.4
Provides support for numerical operations, especially array and matrix manipulations. It is foundational for preprocessing and mathematical computations in clustering algorithms.

pandas==2.0.3
Used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration. It allows efficient handling of structured data in DataFrames, making it easier to manipulate and analyze survey responses.

matplotlib==3.7.1
A plotting library used to create visualizations such as scatter plots and line charts to better understand clustering results and evaluation metrics.

seaborn==0.12.2
Built on top of matplotlib, it simplifies the creation of informative and aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics, including distribution plots and heatmaps for qualitative cluster inspection.

scikit-learn==1.2.2
The primary machine learning library utilized for:

Preprocessing techniques (e.g., scaling and dimensionality reduction via PCA)

Clustering algorithms (KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN, Birch, Spectral Clustering)

Evaluation metrics (Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index)

Model selection and tuning procedures

joblib==1.2.0
Used to efficiently save and load the trained clustering model to disk, ensuring reproducibility and enabling the application of the final model without retraining.
